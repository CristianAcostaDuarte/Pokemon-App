# Pokemon-App 

## Project Description 

The Pokemon App is a personal project that allowed for the exploration of front-end development using HTML and CSS. The web page was designed to provide an immersive experience for Pokemon enthusiasts. The project aimed to create a visually appealing and interactive platform for users to engage with different Pokemon-related content.

The web page incorporates different routes, allowing users to navigate to specific sections seamlessly. The main page serves as an introduction to the Pokemon world, providing an overview of the franchise and its iconic characters. The character description route provides detailed information about different Pokemon, including their abilities, types, and evolutions. The map view route offers an interactive visual representation of the Pokemon world, allowing users to explore various locations and landmarks. Additionally, the activities section provides engaging and interactive elements such as quizzes or games related to Pokemon.
